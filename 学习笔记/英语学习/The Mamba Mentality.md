### The Mamba Mentality

- **WHEN IT CAME TO BASKETBALL, I HAD NO FEAR**

  - If I wanted to **implement something new** into my game, I'd see it and try incorporating it **immediately**.
  - I **wasn't scared** of **missing, looking bad, or being embarrassed**.
  - I always **focused on** the fact that I had to **try something to get it**, and once I got it, I'd **have another tool in my arsenal** [ˈɑːsənl].
  - I would **see something I liked** in person or on film, **go practice it immediately, practice it more** the next day, and then **go out and use it**.
  - By the time I reached the league, I had a **short learning curve**. I could **see something**, **download it**, and **have it down pat**.
  - I **never needed** any **external forces** to **motivate** me.
  - I **didn't need that extra push** to be great，though. From day one, I **wanted to dominate**.
  - My mindset was: **I'm going to figure you out**. Whether it was AI, Tracy, Vince—or, if I were coming up today, LeBron, Russ, Steph—my goal was to figure you out.

- **I DID BIBLICAL WORKOUTS**

  - When I say lift, I mean **heavy, hard, can't-feel-your-arms type of lift**. **After that**, I would go into the gym and **shoot**.
  - If something has **worked for other greats** before you, and if  something is **working for you**, **why change it** up and embrace some new fad? **Stick with what works, even if it's unpopular**.
  - By **starting earlier**, I set myself up for an **extra workout** each day. 
  - **Starting early** helped me **balance basketball and life**. I wasn't willing to sacrifice my game, but I also wasn't willing to sacrifice my family time. So  **I decided to sacrifice sleep**.

- **I DIDN’T TRAIN ONLY MY BODY- I TRAINED MY MIND, TOO**

  - By reading，by paying attention in class and in practice, by working, I **strengthened my focus**. By doing all of that, I strengthened my ability to **be present** and **not have a wandering mind**.
  - Just as important as **reading** was cultivating **relationships with the greats** who’d **come before me**.
  - Those guys( Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, MagicJohnson, Jerry West, James Worthy ) taught me the lessons that **gave me an edge over my competition**. That’s why I think **it’s so important to have those mentors**, those north stars, **who you learn from and look up to**.

- **MY MENTAL PREPARATION VARIED BASED ON MY HEADSPACE**

  - If I needed to **get keyed up**, for example, I  **listened to hardmusic**. If I needed to **soothe myself**, I might play **the same soundtrack** I listened to on the bus in **high school** to **put me back in that place**.
  - Some games **required more intensity**, so I would need to get my character and **mind** in an **animated zone.**
  -  Other games, I needed **calm**. In that situation，I wouldn’t  listen to music. Sometimes, even, I would **sit in total silence**.
  - The key, though, is **being aware** of **how you’re feeling** and **how you need to be feeling**. It all **starts with awareness**.
  - A lot of people say they want to be great, but they’re not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve greatness. They **have other concerns, whether important or not**, and they spread themselves out. That’s totally fine. After all, greatness is not for everybody.
  - Greatness isn’t easy to achieve. It **requires a lot of time, a lot of sacrifices**. It requires a lot of tough choices. It **requires your loved ones to sacrifice**, too, so you have to have an understanding circle of family and friends. 
  - **You can’t achieve greatness by walking a straight line**.
  - **Respect** to those who do achieve greatness, and **respect** to those who are chasing that elusive feeling.
  - I **never had a set routine**, an ironclad formula that I practiced night after night. I **listened to my body** and let it inform my warmup, because there are always variables. That’s the best advice I can give: **listen to your body, and warm up with purpose**.
  - When I jogged out of the tunnel and the fans were screaming and it’s loud, **the noise didn’t impact me**. Mentally, I was able to **remember the stillness of the earlier moment** and carry that with me.

- **I ASKED A TON OF QUESTIONS**

  - A lot of people appreciated my curiosity and passion. They appreciate

    that **I wasn’t just asking to ask**, I was **genuinely thirsty to hear their answers** and **glean new info**.

  - My approach always was that **I’d rather risk embarrassment now than be embarrassed later**,when I’ve won zero titles.

- **JUST DO IT**

  - I **never thought about** my daily **preparation**. It **wasn’t a matter** of **whether it was an option or not**. It was, if I want to play, this is what **I have to do**, so I’d just **show up and do it**.

  - Sometimes, as part of that, I’d be **so tired** I’d need a **quick nap** at some

    point during the day. Whether before practice or a Finals game, on the

    bus or trainer’s table, five hours before tip or 60 minutes, if I was tired I

    would doze off. I always found that short **15-minute catnaps** gave me all the energy I’d need for peak performance.

- **PRESSURE**

  - I never felt outside pressure. I knew **what I wanted to accomplish**, and I knew **how much work it took to achieve those goals**. I then **put in the work and trusted in it**. Besides, the expectations I placed on myself were higher than what anyone expected from me.

- **PLAYING THROUGH THE PAIN**

  - This was right after I hurt my finger on December 11, 2009. Gary was assessing, trying to gauge how bad it was. Pretty much right away, we went back into the bowels of the arena, had it X-rayed, and Gary told me it was fractured. I said, “Alright, cool, now get me back out there.”
  - Gary looked at me like I was crazy.I asked him, “Is it going to get better?” He said no. I said, “Exactly,**there’s nothing we can do about it** now and **it can’t get worse**, so tape **it up and let’s go**.”
